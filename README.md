**What is Antennapp?**

Antennapp is an application that let's you simulate and estimate parameters of several Active electronically scanned array (AESA) types.
Models available for visualization:



**AESA with Controlled Connections**

This is a new AESA type performed supression of active jamming acting from multiple directions.
The algorithm of supression was patented and described in papers.

You can estimate AESA pattern with nulls formed in required directions.

Detailed information about suppressed interferences is available as well.

All input values got from user input.

**AESA with Adaptive Filtering**

By Antennapp you can estimate parameters of an Adaptive Antenna based on classical algorithm of inversion of a covariance matrix.

Oscillograms of clutter (cleaned out of internal antenna noise) and scatter matrix of signals in antenna elements are available for vizualization.

**Ordinary AESA**

You can design an ordinary AESA to estimate an influence of internal phase and amplitude errors and calculate a main lobe and other parameters.
